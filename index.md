      <h2 class="display-4 text-center mb-4">About Me</h2>
      <p>Throughout my academic and professional career, I've focused on developing robust and efficient solutions for complex robotics challenges. My expertise spans across areas like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Robot Perception:</strong> LiDAR and Camera-based object detection, tracking, and 3D reconstruction.</li>
        <li><strong>Motion Planning & Control:</strong> Kinematics, dynamics, path planning, and trajectory optimization for robotic manipulators and mobile robots.</li>
        <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Applying machine learning and deep learning techniques for robotic decision-making and cognitive tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Development:</strong> Proficient in C++ and Python for real-time systems and algorithm implementation, often utilizing ROS (Robot Robot Operating System).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm driven by the goal of contributing to the next generation of autonomous systems that can safely and intelligently operate in various environments, from industrial settings to everyday human spaces. I thrive on problem-solving, enjoy collaborative environments, and am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.</p>
      <p>This portfolio showcases a selection of my **projects** and **experiences**, highlighting my technical skills and passion for bringing intelligent robots to life. Feel free to explore and connect!</p>
