Completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology. This program provided a strong foundation in mechanical principles, which I then applied to my passion for robotics. I actively participated in the university's robotics club, where I led projects involving robotic arm design, mobile robot navigation, and sensor integration, building a solid practical skillset alongside theoretical knowledge.
