Explore some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

### ðŸ”§ Autonomous Mobile Color Cube Sorter  
Vision-based mobile manipulator that detects and sorts colored cubes using HSV segmentation, A* path planning, and PID control.  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/RajasundaramM/ColorCubeSorter)

### ðŸ§  Drone Pose Estimation with Optical Flow + Kalman Filter  
Fused IMU and optical flow using an Extended Kalman Filter to estimate pose of a drone in real time.  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/RajasundaramM/UKF-for-Drone-Pose-Estimation)

### ðŸ¤– Human-Robot Collision Avoidance  
Built a proactive safety system that predicts human motion using pose estimation and neural networks in simulation.  
<!-- You can add image tiles later -->
