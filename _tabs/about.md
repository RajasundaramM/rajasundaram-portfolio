Hi! I'm **Rajasundaram Mathiazhagan**, a robotics engineer with strong interests in perception, autonomy, and intelligent systems.  
Currently completing my master's in Mechatronics and Robotics at NYU, I’ve built and deployed various robotics systems — from vision-guided manipulators to deep learning-based pose estimators.

I'm passionate about solving real-world challenges using robotic systems that learn, adapt, and act.  
Feel free to explore my work and get in touch!
