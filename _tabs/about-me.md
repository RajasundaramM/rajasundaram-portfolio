## Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hi, I'm **Rajasundaram Mathiazhagan**, a passionate Robotics Engineer with a strong background in **autonomy, perception, and intelligent systems**. My journey in robotics began with a fascination for creating machines that can sense, understand, and interact with the world around them.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I've focused on developing robust and efficient solutions for complex robotics challenges. My expertise spans across areas like:

* **Robot Perception:** LiDAR and Camera-based object detection, tracking, and 3D reconstruction.
* **Motion Planning & Control:** Kinematics, dynamics, path planning, and trajectory optimization for robotic manipulators and mobile robots.
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Applying machine learning and deep learning techniques for robotic decision-making and cognitive tasks.
* **Software Development:** Proficient in C++ and Python for real-time systems and algorithm implementation, often utilizing ROS (Robot Operating System).

I'm driven by the goal of contributing to the next generation of autonomous systems that can safely and intelligently operate in various environments, from industrial settings to everyday human spaces. I thrive on problem-solving, enjoy collaborative environments, and am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.

This portfolio showcases a selection of my **projects** and **experiences**, highlighting my technical skills and passion for bringing intelligent robots to life. Feel free to explore and connect!
