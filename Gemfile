# If you use any other plugins that are not part of GitHub Pages' default gems
# (like jekyll-archives or jekyll-seo-tag if they are not included in the Chirpy theme's dependencies)
# you'll need to list them here too.
# Example:
# gem "jekyll-feed"
# gem "jekyll-sitemap"
# gem "jekyll-seo-tag"
# gem "jekyll-archives"

# This gem is required for GitHub Pages to build the site.
# It ensures Jekyll's version matches GitHub Pages' environment.
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "github-pages", "~> 232" # Use the version mentioned in the log, or the latest compatible for Chirpy
end

# If your theme's Gemfile includes this, keep it. Otherwise, you might not need it.
# gem "webrick", "~> 1.8" # For local development on newer Ruby versions
